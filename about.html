            This is website dedicated for collaboratinve work between Vinay and Harshit. We are currently practicing 'git' and are trying to master the same. 
            This site will serve as a plotform to showcase the collaborative work. 
            Git is a Distributed Version control System. As with many great things in life, Git began with a bit of creative destruction and fiery controversy.
            The Linux kernel is an open source software project of fairly large scope. For most of the lifetime of
            the Linux kernel maintenance (1991–2002), changes to the software were passed around as patches
            and archived files. In 2002, the Linux kernel project began using a proprietary DVCS called
            BitKeeper.
            In 2005, the relationship between the community that developed the Linux kernel and the
            commercial company that developed BitKeeper broke down, and the tool’s free-of-charge status
            was revoked. This prompted the Linux development community (and in particular Linus Torvalds,
            the creator of Linux) to develop their own tool based on some of the lessons they learned while
            using BitKeeper.

            <h2>What is Git?</h2>
            So, what is Git in a nutshell? This is an important section to absorb, because if you understand what Git is and the fundamentals of how it works, then using Git effectively will probably be much easier
    for you. As you learn Git, try to clear your mind of the things you may know about other VCSs, such as CVS, Subversion or Perforce — doing so will help you avoid subtle confusion when using the tool. Even though Git’s user interface is fairly similar to these other VCSs, Git stores and thinks about information in a very different way, and understanding these differences will help you avoid becoming confused while using it.
